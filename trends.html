                <h4>5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy in July 2022</h4>
                <p>
                    While crypto investors wait for the next bullish cycle, July 2022 is still a good time to buy crypto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many major cryptocurrencies are at their lowest prices in 18 months. Once the crypto market recovers above $1 trillion, it will be hard to get such good returns on investment again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below, we’ll look at bullish reasons to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, and EverGrow Coin.&nbsp;

                    <h3> BITCOIN</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bitcoin is trading at $19,600 today. While the Bitcoin price is volatile, it has found strong support at under $19,000 and has not stayed under such a low price for more than a few hours. With interest rates finally raised, and a lot of uncertainty removed, it’s like Bitcoin will keep going up from here.

                    <h3> ETHEREUM</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ethereum gets bad press for its slow transaction speeds and high processing fees. But that’s because it powers a huge amount of the crypto market – including the largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, OpenSea. When Ethereum finally completes The Merge to a proof-of-stake blockchain system (expected this summer 2022) this will be a catalyst for bullish investment.

                    <h3> BNB</h3>
                        <p>
                            BNB is trading at $222 today. The token powers the world’s largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume – Binance – and is going from strength to strength in 2022. While Coinbase and Crypto.com and Bybit cut staff, Binance announced it was hiring.

                    <h3> Cardano</h3>
                        <p>
                            Cardano has been fighting a battle with XRP and Solana for the 7th spot in the crypto market cap rankings. Today, it has flipped XRP again while putting $4 billion between Solana and ADA. Cardano will implement the anticipated Vasil hardfork this month, which could make predictions of Cardano becoming a major smart contract platform and NFT platform reality.

                    <h3> EverGrow Coin</h3>
                        <p>
                            EverGrow Coin is the baby in this list – it only launched in September last year – but it’s already become the top reflection token in crypto.
                            From a 14% transaction tax, EverGrow Coin has paid out more than $37 million in BUSD. When daily trading volume peaked in January at $12 million, EverGrow Coin was paying around $1 million in BUSD reflections every day. 
                            BUSD rewards have fallen during the bear market to around $15,000 daily – but many investors are buying the EverGrow Coin dip at $0.000000137 to see amazing ROI when daily trading volumes pick up again. EverGrow Coin is also launching an NFT Marketplace – LunaSky – and a content subscription platform – Crator – to ensure greater exposure and volume when the bull market returns.
